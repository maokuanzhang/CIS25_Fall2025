### File Description
Midterm.cpp – contains the BankAccount class and the main function implementing deposit, purchase, and transaction features.<br>
transactions.txt – text file that stores all transactions made during the program run (such as deposits and purchases).

### Program Description
This program proves the use of:<br>
1.Classes and Objects – the BankAccount class manages all banking functions.<br>
2.File Input/Output (I/O) – saves and reads transaction records from transactions.txt<br>
3.Functions and Encapsulation – methods such as deposit(), makePurchase(), and showAllTransactions() encapsulate core operations.<br>


### Program Function
This program simulates a simple bank account system that can record transactions to a file:<br>
1.Simulate a user to deposit money into the account<br>
2.Enables the user to make purchases by specifying an item name and its cost<br>
3.Automatically saves each transaction to a file named transactions.txt<br>
4.Displays the current balance<br>
5.Reads and prints the full transaction history from the file at the end of execution<br>

This program simulates a basic bank account system that handles deposits, purchases, and file-based transaction recording.
