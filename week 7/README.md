### File Description
main.cpp - source file that defines the Item struct, implements binary search by id, and demonstrates dynamic memory allocation and free, display the results.<br>


### Program Description
This program proves the use of:<br>
1.Structures – Defines a struct named Item with two members: name (string) and id (int);<br>
2.Dynamic Memory Allocation (new/delete[]) – Allocates and frees memory for an array;<br>
3.Binary Search – Efficiently finds an item by its ID in a sorted array;<br>
4.Conditional Statements and Loops – Uses if/else for decision-making and for/while loops for populating and searching through data

### Program Function
The program performs the following functions:<br>
1.Dynamically allocates an array of 100 Item objects using new;<br>
2.Populates the array with sorted sample data;<br>
3.Prompts the user to enter an ID number between 1 and 100;<br>
3.Performs a binary search on the array to find the item with the specified ID;<br>
3.Displays the search result — showing both the name and ID if found, or not found;<br>
3.Frees dynamically allocated memory using delete[]

This program dynamically creates an array of 100 items sorted by name and uses a binary search algorithm to find and display an item by its ID.
